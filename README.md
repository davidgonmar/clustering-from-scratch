# Clustering from scratch

Implementation of various clustering algorithms from scratch in Python.

## Requirements

For the example scripts, sklearn is used to generate some datasets and matplotlib is used to plot the results.
The list can be found in `requirements.txt`.

## Implemented algorithms

- K-means
- DBSCAN
- Fuzzy C-means
